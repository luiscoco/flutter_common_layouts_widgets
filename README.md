# flutter_common_layouts_widgets

Flutter has a rich library of **layout widgets**. 

Here are a few of those most commonly used. 

The intent is to get you up and running as quickly as possible, rather than overwhelm you with a complete list. 

For information on other available widgets, refer to the **Widget catalog**, or use the Search box in the API reference docs. 

https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/layout

Also, the widget pages in the API docs often make suggestions about similar widgets that might better suit your needs.

The following widgets fall into two categories: standard widgets from the widgets library, and specialized widgets from the Material library. 

Any app can use the widgets library but only Material apps can use the Material Components library.

## Standard widgets

**Container**: Adds padding, margins, borders, background color, or other decorations to a widget.

**GridView**: Lays widgets out as a scrollable grid.

**ListView**: Lays widgets out as a scrollable list.

**Stack**: Overlaps a widget on top of another.

## Material widgets

**Card**: Organizes related info into a box with rounded corners and a drop shadow.

**ListTile**: Organizes up to 3 lines of text, and optional leading and trailing icons, into a row.
